A basic calculator android app written in Kotlin. 

**Features:**
* Basic calculator logic is implemented (multiplication, division, subtraction, addition)
* Instant access to calculator history

**What needs to be improved:**
* I did't really get how to implement a proper percentage calculation of a given number. 
Since I concinder this a kind of a toy app, I didn't really bother trying to implement this feature. However, I'm always open for any suggestions ðŸ˜‡
